# Watermark Screen Open Source for Business

## Project summary

**Goal:** Build a native watermark software for Windows that makes it impossible to close it through the Windows context menu, since third-party watermarks such as Rainmeter provide the functionality to close it, making it unusable for the function watermark to ensure data reliability. 

<b> The technologies and applications used were: </b> 
- .NET Framework 4.8;
- C# Version 7.3;
- Windows Forms template (WinForms)

A specific calculation was created to fit responsiveness in different resolutions. <br>

**Conclusion:** Since the build product of this project results in a single Windows 10 native executable (.NET Framework 4.8) with no dependencies required, the deployment process becomes quick and easy. This executable can be used by SysAdmin professionals and applied to a domain of computers, through Active Directory GPOs.
